                                      ====

- add test: service.get_task(id) whereas id is ID of a contact
- SIGPIPE issue, investigate, options?
- implement ews::body
- Set-up a new Exchange VM on some KVM host
- raise_exception_if_soap_fault: parsing payload might throw parse_error, what
  then?
- Why do we start parsing XML payload when server's response code is 503?
- Add example: assign task to multiple mailbox owners, update task, check who
  has completed it
- Document exception hierarchy; in Doxygen
- body, mime_content, et al. should be wrapped with something like
  boost::optional<>, right? See mime_content::none()
- fix wrong libeay32.dll usage on Marlena's machine (Intel's one instead of
  libcurl's), how to manipulate the path?
