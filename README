You can obtain an up-to-date and easy-to-use binary distribution of libcurl
from here:

    http://www.confusedbycode.com/curl/

Additionally, you probably need to tell CMake where to find it. Just set
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to the path where you installed libcurl (e.g.
C:\Program Files\cURL) and re-configure.
